  <p>In this workshop, we will use machine learning service provided by Center for eResearch. 
      This service provides access to a <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook</a>. 
   A Jupyter notebook lets you write and execute Python
code in your web browser. Jupyter notebooks make it very easy to tinker with
code and execute it in bits and pieces; for this reason Jupyter notebooks are
widely used in scientific computing.</p>

If you are new to Jupyter notebook environment and want to get the feel of it you can <a href="http://try.jupyter.org" target="_blank">click here </a> to try it in your browser. Alternatively, you can easily install it in your computer using following commands.

<p>From the command line, the following
will install Jupyter:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip install jupyter
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Or the following if you use conda/Anaconda:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>conda install jupyter
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once you have Jupyter installed, start it with this command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>jupyter notebook
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Once Jupyter is running, point your web browser at http://localhost:8888 to
start using Jupyter notebooks. If everything worked correctly, you should
see a screen like this, showing all available Jupyter notebooks in the current
directory:</p>

<div class="fig figcenter">
  <img src="img/file-browser.png" />
</div>

<p>If you click through to a notebook file, you will see a screen like this:</p>

<div class="fig figcenter">
  <img src="img/notebook-1.png" />
</div>

<p>A Jupyter notebook is made up of a number of <strong>cells</strong>. Each cell can contain
Python code. You can execute a cell by clicking on it and pressing <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shift-Enter</code>.
When you do so, the code in the cell will run, and the output of the cell
will be displayed beneath the cell. For example, after running the first cell
the notebook looks like this:</p>

<div class="fig figcenter">
  <img src="img/notebook-2.png" />
</div>

<p>Global variables are shared between cells. Executing the second cell thus gives
the following result:</p>

<div class="fig figcenter">
  <img src="img/notebook-3.png" />
</div>

<p>By convention, Jupyter notebooks are expected to be run from top to bottom.
Failing to execute some cells or executing cells out of order can result in
errors:</p>

<div class="fig figcenter">
  <img src="img/notebook-error.png" />
</div>

<p>After you have modified a Jupyter notebook for one of the assignments by
modifying or executing some of its cells, remember to <strong>save your changes!</strong></p>

<p>This has only been a brief introduction to Jupyter Notebook, but it should
be enough to get you up and running on the assignments for this course. Check out
